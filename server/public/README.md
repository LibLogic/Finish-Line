# Finish Line Game

https://liblogic.github.io/Finish-Line/

I have chosen to build this game as a way to demonstrate my abiltiy to solve
complex coding problems. In this case I'm using Javascript as my language of choice.

## Finish Line is a card game that is played more like a board game.
### Finish line uses a deck of cards, two dice and a set of 3 markers for each player.
